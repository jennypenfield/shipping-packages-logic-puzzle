## Problem Description

Yesterday, Greg was very busy packing up some gifts to send out to family and friends. It was a busy month. He had a birthday,
an anniversary, a wedding, and even a house warming to send gifts out for - and the events all took place in the same week!
Because he moved away from his home area when he took his new job, he lived across the country from most of his family and friends now.
As a result, he always tried to find something locally for each person to make each gift more personal and interesting. Determine the
full name of each person he shipped a gift to, what state each lived in, what each event was, each person’s relationship to Greg,
and what day of the week each event was taking place (Wednesday through Saturday).

1.  Greg’s friend wasn’t Ellen Fairview, who didn’t live in Ohio. The birthday girl didn’t have her party on Friday.

2.  Rick’s last name wasn’t Bartley but his event was on Saturday night.

3.  Greg’s father wasn’t getting married, but his last name was Gray.

4.  The friend having a house warming didn’t live in Ohio.

5.  The wedding was for Greg’s cousin. Heather, who didn’t live in Texas, was Greg’s sister but her event wasn’t on Wednesday night.

6.  Walter’s event was one day earlier than the person whose last name was DeForest but after the person who lived in Washington.
The anniversary was held in Montana.
